# Fulcro â€¢ [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fulcrologic/fulcro-todomvc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fulcrologic/fulcro-todomvc)

This is a  full-stack implementation of
the TodoMVC application. It extends the requirements of the standard TodoMVC to include:

- Server-side Persistence: Lists are persisted in an in-memory Datomic instance (you can have more than one list, selected by adding a ?list=X param to URL).
- Internationalization 
- Support VCR Viewer

## Configure it (optional):

You can edit `resources/config/dev.edn`, which contains:

```
{ 
 :datomic {
   :dbs {
     :todo {:url "datomic:mem://todo" 
            :schema "todomvc.migrations" 
            :auto-migrate true 
            :auto-drop true}}} 
 :port 3000} 
```

You can configure the datomic database URL to a file-based one if you 
wish, in which case you might want to turn off `auto-drop` so
your lists persist over server restarts. Leave
`auto-migrate` on, since that just makes sure the schema is up-to-date.

## Running it:

### Figwheel/Clojurescript Build

Start figwheel (the JVM options tell figwheel which builds to run):

```
JVM_OPTS="-Ddev -Dtest" lein run -m clojure.main script/figwheel.clj
```

which should start auto-building the cljs source and show a browser REPL.

You can do this in IntelliJ using a regular Clojure Main REPL that runs
`script/figwheel.clj` (Parameters field). Put the `-Ddev` and `-Dtest` options can go in the JVM
arguments field.

Our internal figwheel support uses Java system properties to select the
builds you want to start (so you can create multiple run profiles for
different tasks that target only specific builds). The supported build IDs
are whatever builds are defined in the project file (it extracts build 
configurations from there). So, including `-Dtest` in the JVM arguments
will include the build of tests.

### Server

Start a CLJ REPL (e.g. command line or IntelliJ):

```
lein repl
```

At the REPL, start the server:

```
(go)
```

Navigate to: [http://localhost:3000/dev.html?list=MyList](http://localhost:3000/dev.html?list=MyList)

The list URL parameter allows you to select which persisted TODO list on the server
you want.

If you make changes to the source code hot code reload will re-render without a browser reload.

Changes to server code can be put into effect at the REPL (NOTE: will wipe database) with:

```
(reset)
```

## Running the tests

The figwheel build above will start the client test build. Simply open
(any number of) browsers on 
[http://localhost:3000/fulcro-spec-client-tests.html](http://localhost:3000/fulcro-spec-client-tests.html)

## Internationalization

The i18n support has been integrated into this example.

Some basics:

- The functions `tr` and `trf` are used to format string (in English).
- Strings can be extracted for use with GNU gettext against the whitespace-optimized generated javascript.
- Translations can be processed with GNU tools like poedit.
- Translations can be used to generate cljs code files for the locales.
- See `src/fulcro_todomvc/i18n/es_MX.cljs` to see what the generated translation code looks like.
- Search for uses of `tr` and `trf` in `src/fulcro_todomvc/ui.cljs` to see what it looks like to work with them in UI.
- Missing translations simply show up untranslated (not as blanks).

## Viewing a Support Request

You'll need to start the build that creates the support viewer, so use this
to start figwheel (restart figwheel and add `-Dsupport` to your JVM options):

```
JVM_OPTS="-Ddev -Dtest -Dsupport" lein run -m clojure.main script/figwheel.clj
```

Start the server as before.

Now load dev.html as before, do some operations, and create a support request
using the Help button at the top of the screen. The server will persist it 
(in memory only), and give a support ID in the **server logs** (starting with ID 1001). Simply open the
support viewer with this URL (embedding the correct ID from the server log):

[http://localhost:3000/support.html?id=1001](http://localhost:3000/support.html?id=1001)

You should now be able to step back in time through up to 100 steps of history. Each support request 
is stored separately. The implementation on this server does not persist them
to Datomic, so they only exist for the lifetime of the server.
